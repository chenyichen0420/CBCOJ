## CBCOJ

### What's CBCOJ

CBCOJ is a super lightweight mini OJ that can and only supports login, logout, obtaining questions, submitting reviews, and querying review results.

~~This OJ is not accessible through a browser like other OJs, it is just a pair of accompanying programs where the client interacts with the server.~~

Such descriptions has already became history. Now it has both front-end and back-end, able to reach on 

However, it remains super lightweight as all the codes were written on hand, without using any existing extension libs or softwares.
