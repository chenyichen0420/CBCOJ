## CBCOJ

### What's CBCOJ

CBCOJ is a super lightweight mini OJ that can and only supports login, logout, obtaining questions, submitting reviews, and querying review results.

~~This OJ is not accessible through a browser like other OJs, it is just a pair of accompanying programs where the client interacts with the server.~~

Such descriptions has already became history. Now it has both front-end and back-end, able to reach on 

However, it remains super lightweight as all the codes were written on hand, without using any existing extension libs or softwares.

In addition, I've finished many tests on this OJ. It finishes 100K login requests in about 8 seconds(without any access limitation).

For the front-end, we used Node.js+HTML+css for convenient web page rendering.

For the back-end, we used the more efficient C++ for high-speed and low consumption processing.

These factors gives CBCOJ some significant advantages:

1. High portability
2. Low hardware requirements
3. High access efficiency

You can imaging that there's a lot more benefits other than the above advantages. So it's ULTRA suitable if you want to run a personal/local OJ with nearly zero cost!
